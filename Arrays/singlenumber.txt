Given an array of positive integers where every element appears even times except for one. Find that number occuring odd number of times.

Input:
First line will consist  a number T, the number of test cases. Each test case will then consist of an integer N denoting the size of array. Next line will consist of N space separated integers, the array elements.

Output:
Print the element that appears odd times in the array.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 30
1 <= N <= 107
0 <= Ai <= 108

Example:
Input:
2
5
1 1 2 2 2
7
8 8 7 7 6 6 1

Output:
2
1

Explanation:
Testcase 1: In the given array 1 is present even number of times and 2 is present odd number of times.
