Given an array of elements which is first increasing and then may be decreasing, find the maximum element in the array.
Note: If the array is increasing then just print then last element will be the maximum value.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case is N, the size of array, the second line of each test case contains N integers which are the array elements.

Output:
Print the maximum element in the array.

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 50
3 ≤ N ≤ 106
1 ≤ Ai ≤ 106

Example:
Input:
2
9
1 15 25 45 42 21 17 12 11
5
1 45 47 50 5

Output:
45
50

Explanation:
Testcase 1: Maximum element is 45 which is present at bitonic point.
