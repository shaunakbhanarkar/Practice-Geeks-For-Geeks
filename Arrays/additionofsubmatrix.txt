Given a matrix C of size N x M. You are given position of submatrix as X1, Y1 and X2, Y2 inside the matrix. Find the sum of all elements inside that submatrix.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The first line of each test case is n and m,n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns. The second line of each test case contains C[N][M]. The third line contains four value of X1, Y1, X2, Y2. X1, Y1 is the top left cell and X2, Y2 is the bottom right cell.

Output:
Print the sum of all elements inside that submatrix.

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 15
1 ≤ N, M ≤ 103
1 ≤ C[N][M] ≤ 106
1 <= X1, Y1, X2, Y2 <= M

Example:

26
Explanation:
Testcase 2: Sum from cell starting at position (1, 2) (1-based indexing) and ending at (3, 3) is 26.
