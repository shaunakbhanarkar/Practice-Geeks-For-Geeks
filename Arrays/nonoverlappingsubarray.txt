Given an array of N elements, you are required to find the maximum sum of lengths of all non-overlapping subarrays with K as the maximum element in the subarray.
.
Input:
First line of the input contains an integer T, denoting the number of the total test cases. Then T test case follows. First line of the test case contains an integer N, denoting the number of elements in the array. Then next line contains N space separated integers denoting the elements of the array. The last line of each test case contains an integer K.

Output:
For each test case ouptut a single line denoting the sum of the length of all such subarrays.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 105
1 <= A[] <= 105

Example:
Input:
3
9 
2 1 4 9 2 3 8 3 4
4
7
1 2 3 2 3 4 1
4
10
4 5 7 1 2 9 8 4 3 1
4
Output:
5
7
4
Explanation:
Test Case 1: 
{2, 1, 4} => Length = 3 
{3, 4} => Length = 2 
So, 3 + 2 = 5 is the answer

Test Case 2: {1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 1} => Length = 7

Test Case 3:
{4} => Length = 1 
{4, 3, 1} => Length = 3 
So, 1 + 3 = 4 is the answer.
