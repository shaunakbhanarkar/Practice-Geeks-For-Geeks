Given an array A[] of size N and an integer K. Your task is to complete the function countDistinct() which prints the count of distinct numbers in all windows of size k in the array A[].

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains two integers N and K. Then in the next line are N space separated values of the array A[].

Output:
For each test case in a new line print the space separated values denoting counts of distinct numbers in all windows of size k in the array A[].

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N, K <= 100
1 <= A[] <= 100

Example(To be used only for expected output):
Input:
2
7 4
1 2 1 3 4 2 3
3 2
4 1 1

Output:
3 4 4 3
2 1

Note:The Input/Ouput format and Example given are used for system's internal purpose, and should be used by a user for Expected Output only. As it is a function problem, hence a user should not read any input from stdin/console. The task is to complete the function specified, and not to write the full code.
