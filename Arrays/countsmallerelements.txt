Given an array A of positive integers. Count number of smaller elements on right side of each array.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The first line of each test case is N,N is the size of array. The second line of each test case contains N input arr[i].

Output:
Print the countSmaller array.

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 106
1 <= Ai  <= 108

Example:
Input:
2
7
12 1 2 3 0 11 4
5
1 2 3 4 5

Output:
6 1 1 1 0 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Explanation:
Testcase 1: 6 elements are greater than 1 on its right side in original array. Similarly 1 element is greater than 4 on its right side in original array.
