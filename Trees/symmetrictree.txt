Given a Binary Tree of size N, your task is to complete the function isSymettric(), that check whether a binary is Symmetric or not, i.e. the binary tree is Mirror image of itself or not.
For example:
The following binary tree is symmetric:

        1
      /   \
    2       2
  /   \   /   \
 3     4 4     3

But the following is not:

       1
     /   \
    2      2
     \      \
      3      3
Input:

The function takes a single argument as input, the root node of the binary tree. There will be T test cases and for each test case the function will be called separately. 
 

Output:
For each testcase the function should return a boolean value.

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=N<=100

Example:
Input:
3
1 1
1 2 L 1 2 R 0
2 1
10 20 R 10 20 L 20 30 R 5
2 2
10 20 R 10 20 L 10 20 R 10 20 L 20 30 L 100 

Output:
True
False
True

Explanation:
TestCase 1:

             0
           /   \
          1     1
         /       \
        2         2
Tree is mirror image of itself i.e. tree is symmetric

TestCase 2:

             5
          /    \
        10      20
      /    \      \
    20     20      30 
Tree is not mirror image of itself i.e. tree is not symmetric

TestCase 3:

              100
            /     \
          10       10
         /   \    /   \
       20     20 20    20
Tree is mirror image of itself i.e. tree is symmetric

Note:The Input/Ouput format and Example given are used for system's internal purpose, and should be used by a user for Expected Output only. As it is a function problem, hence a user should not read any input from stdin/console. The task is to complete the function specified, and not to write the full code.
