Given three integers  'A' denoting the first term of an arithmetic sequence , 'C' denoting the common difference of an arithmetic sequence and an integer 'B'. you need to tell whether 'B' exists in the arithmetic sequence or not.

Input
First line of input contains of an integer 'T' denoting number of test cases. Then T test cases follow . Each test case contains three integers A,B,C.  Only line of each test case contains three integers A,B and C .

Output
For each case in a new line print 1 if B is found in sequence else print 0 if B is not found in sequence .

Constraints:
1<=t<=100
- 10^9 ≤ A, B, C ≤ 10^9


Example:

Input:
