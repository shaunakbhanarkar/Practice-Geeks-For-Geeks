The task is to complete merge() function which is used to implement Merge Sort.

Input:
First line of the input denotes number of test cases 'T'. First line of the testcase is the size of array and second line consists of array elements separated by space.

Output:
Sorted array in increasing order is displayed to the user.

User Task:
Since this is a functional problem you don't have to worry about input, you just have to complete the function merge().

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 50
1 <= N <= 103
1 <= arr[i] <= 103

Example:
Input:
2
5
4 1 3 9 7
10
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

Output:
1 3 4 7 9
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

Explanation:
Testcase 1: The array after performing mergesort is: 1 3 4 7 9.
