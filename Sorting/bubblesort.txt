The task is to complete bubble function which is used to implement Bubble Sort!

Input Format:
First line of the input denotes the number of test cases 'T'. First line of the test case is the size of array and second line consists of array elements.

Output Format:
For each testcase, in a new line, print the sorted array.

Your Task:
This is a function problem. You only need to complete the function bubble that sorts the array. Printing is done automatically by the driver code.

Constraints:
1 <=T<= 100
1 <=N<= 103
1 <=arr[i]<= 103

Example:
Input:
2
5
4 1 3 9 7
10
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
Output:
1 3 4 7 9
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

Explanation:
Testcase 1: 1 3 4 7 9 are in sorted form.
