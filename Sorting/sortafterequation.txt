Given a sorted integer array of size N, and 3 integers A, B and C. The task is to find and print a new array in sorted order(increasing) where
                                                                        Ainew=A*Aiold*Aiold+B*Aiold+C

Input:
The first line of input contains T denoting the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains three integers A, B, and C, as described above. The second line of each test case contains a single integer N, the size of the input array. The third line of each test case contains N-space separated integers, denoting the array.

Output:
For each test case output, a single line containing N-space separated integers, the elements of the new array in sorted order.

Constraints:
1<= T <= 1000
-105<= A,B,C <= 105
1<=N<=102
-105<= Ai <= 105

Example:
Input:

1
-1 2 -1
6
-1 0 1 2 3 4
Output:
-9 -4 -4 -1 -1 0

Explanation:
After sorting, we get {-9, -4, -4, -1, -1, 0}
After applying the equation A*x*x + B*x + C on every element x we get, {-4,-1, 0, -1, -4, -9}
Input array is {-1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4}.
