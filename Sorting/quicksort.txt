Given an array arr[] of size N. The task is to complete partition() function which is used to implement Quick Sort.

Input Format:
First line of the input denotes number of test cases 'T'. First line of the test case is the size of array and second line consists of array elements.

Output Format:
For each testcase, in a new line, print the sorted array.

Your Task:
This is a function problem. You only need to complete the function partition(). The printing is done automatically by the driver code.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 50
1 <= N <= 103
1 <= arr[i] <= 104

Example:
Input:
2
5
4 1 3 9 7
10
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

Output:
1 3 4 7 9
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

Explanation:
Testcase 1: Elements in sorted form are 1 3 4 7 9.
