Given a boolean 2D array, where each row is sorted. Find the row with the maximum number of 1s.

Example
Input matrix
0 1 1 1
0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1  // this row has maximum 1s
0 0 0 0

Output: 2

Input:
The first line of input is an integer T denoting the no of test cases.Then T test cases follow. Each test case consists of 2 lines . The first line of each test case is are two integers row and col denoting the no of rows and columns of matrix . Then in the next line are row*col space separated values of the matrix M.

Output:
For each test case in a new line print the required first row index .

Constraints:
1<=T<=20
1<=row,col<=40
0<=M[ ][ ]<=1

Example:
Input:
2
3 4
0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1
2 2
0 1 1 1
 
Output:
