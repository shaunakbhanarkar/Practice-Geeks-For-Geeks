Given a string containing 0’s and 1’s. The task is to find out minimum number of bits to be flipped such that 0’s and 1’s will be alternative.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains a string.

Output:
For each test case, print the minimum number of flipped bits in a new line.

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=|string length|<=104

Example:
Input:
2
0011
011000
Output:
2
3
