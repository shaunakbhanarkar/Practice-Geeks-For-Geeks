Write a program to print Binary representation of a given number N.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Each test case contains an integer N.

Output:
For each test case, print the binary representation of the number N in 14 bits.

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 5000

Example:
Input:
2
2
5

Output:
00000000000010
00000000000101
