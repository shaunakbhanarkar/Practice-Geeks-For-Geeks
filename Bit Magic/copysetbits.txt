Given two numbers x and y, and a range [l, r] where 1 <= l, r <= 32. The task is consider set bits of y in range [l, r] and set these bits in x also.

For example, if x = 10, y = 13, l = 2, r = 3,  the program should change x to 14. Binary representation of 10 is 1010 and that of y is 1101. There is one set bit in y at 3’rd position (in given range). After we copy this bit to x, x becomes 1110 which is binary representation of 14.

 

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each test case contains space separated values of x, l, r and y in a single line.

 

Output:
Print modified value of x.
 

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 50
1 ≤ x ≤ 10000
1 ≤ l, r ≤ 32
1 ≤ y ≤ 10000

Example:

Input:
2
44 1 5 3
16 1 3 2

Output:
47
18
