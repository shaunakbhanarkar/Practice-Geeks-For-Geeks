Given a postfix expression, the task is to evaluate the expression and print the final value. Operators will only include the basic arithmetic operators like *,/,+ and - . 

Input:
The first line of input will contains an integer T denoting the no of test cases . Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains an postfix expression.

Output:
For each test case, in a new line, evaluate the postfix expression and print the value.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= length of expression <= 100

Example:
Input:
2
231*+9-
123+*8-
Output:
-4
-3
