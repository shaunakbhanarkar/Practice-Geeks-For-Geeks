Given N * M string array of O's and X's. The task is to find the number of 'X' total shapes. 'X' shape consists of one or more adjacent X's (diagonals not included).

Input: The first line of input takes the number of test cases T. Then T test cases follow. Each of the T test cases takes 2 input lines. The first line of each test case have two integers N and M.The second line of N space separated strings follow which indicate the elements in the array.

Output:
For each testcase, print number of shapes.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N, M <= 50

Example:
Input:
2
4 7
OOOOXXO OXOXOOX XXXXOXO OXXXOOO
10 3
XXO OOX OXO OOO XOX XOX OXO XXO XXX OOO

Output:
4
6

Explanation:
Testcase 1: Given input is like:
OOOOXXO
OXOXOOX
XXXXOXO
OXXXOOO

So, X with same colour are adjacent to each other vertically for horizontally (diagonals not included). So, there are 4 different groups in the given matrix.

Testcase 2: Given input is like:
XXO
OOX
OXO
OOO
XOX
XOX
OXO
XXO
XXX
OOO
So, this matrix has 6 groups with is having adjacent Xs. Total number of groups is 6.
